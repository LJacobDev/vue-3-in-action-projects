# p05-settings-page

A simulated settings page, built using TypeScript.  It is meant to demonstrate Vue Transition, Teleport, and KeepAlive components, along with some ways that TypeScript can help to reduce possible errors by other developers who use these components by restricting values to certain types at design time.  It also provides some additional practice at building HTML forms and styling them.
