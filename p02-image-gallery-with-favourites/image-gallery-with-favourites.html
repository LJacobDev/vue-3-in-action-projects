<!--
     Rather than copying the starter code all at once and pasting it,
     I'm going to type in parts of it from memory, 
     and some other parts (the style tag) by hand 
     to help think and feel about what each part is there for
-->

<!-- 
    Once the functionality to add a photo has been completed, the course instructor gives an exercise to perform:

    - add the ability to click the favourite button and toggle favourite class on the image, so that the button turns gold

    - add the ability to remove an image by clicking on it.
        I have decided to add an x button on the top right instead of clicking on the image itself.
        This will allow the image to be clicked on for other reasons, 
        such as enlarging the image which is what would be expected in this situation vs deleting it

    I'm going to complete these tasks before I check whether the instructor's implementation was much different

    My result:

        I was able to add an x button on the top right of each image, and clicking it does delete a photo from the list,
        but it is not deleting the final photo.  I have been using the same one photo repeatedly instead of different ones,
        so it is less obvious whether I have the indexing right or not.

        It appears to have to do with the fact that I was using the photo.id as the index by which to remove it,
        and it no longer is a valid index to use when a splice has occurred that changes the indexing

        in order to make it find the intended photo, I'm going to do a traversal through the list and look for
        which index is the photo id, however this is going to be suboptimal and I wonder if the instructor
        has a better way


        I was able to get the .isFavourite property of each photo image to toggle true and false, 
        but I didn't get it to reactively change the class with the method I tried

        I will do a commit of this version as a checkpoint before I see the instructor's solutions and see
        where I was needing to probably use a ref or computed value to get the favourite star to change colour,
        as well as to see if the instructor had a better way to get the photos to delete

        The instructor showed his button colour changing code and I saw that mine wasn't working because this line:
          :class="{'favourite-button.active': 'photo.isFavourite'}"
        needed to say this:
          :class="{'active': photo.isFavourite}"


        AS FOR THE INDEXING FOR DELETION:

          the instructor has the v-for loop that creates the images get the index at the time,
          so splice deleting something at that index will shorten the array,
          and then the next time it is rendered it will have refreshed indexing instead of using photo.id
          before seeing what the instructor actually did syntaxwise, I want to try it out myself and then see him do it
