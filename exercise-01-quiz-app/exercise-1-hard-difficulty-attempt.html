Quiz App Exercise

The teacher suggested doing this exercise in one of several varying levels of challenge/difficulty.

The way I wanted to do it was to just see the demonstration of the quiz app functions, then make it myself without any starter code and without seeing the logic flowchart yet

Then after doing this, I want to see what the logic flowchart shows to see what might have been missed or is of interest to notice

Information About Quiz App Based On Demonstration of it:

Text on top,
Input field (for answers) below text


your goal is to answer the questions as quickly as possible, so that implies that there might be an ascending timer that is used to impact the score by perhaps subtracting the seconds taken from the score points


The question texts say:

Next question
How much is 2+2

Next question
How much is 3*5+1

Next question
What is the result from 3/1

you type an answer into the input field and pressing enter will clear the input field and change the question text to the next one

Finally It has a text on top:

"Your Score: 3"
over top of an input field


So it doesn't say "right, wrong" while taking the quiz but just shows a score at the end without indicating which questions were answered right


My plan will be to store the questions as objects in an array, with 'question' text and 'answer' text, where they can be pulled from the first element of the list and asked

a way to detect enter key press needs to happen so an event can cause the input answer to be evaluated against the question object's answer key, and a score variable tallied

there is also a repeating settimeout that runs for 1000 milliseconds and reduces score by 1 each timeout



The entire app will be typed from memory or imagination, including the script area that launches the Vue app, except for:

    - the initial html ! boilerplate shortcut
    - the urls to the unpkg for normalize.css and for Vue
    - any places where I got stuck and had to refer to the can-you-drive.html for a hint - and lines where that has occurred will be marked with comments saying so

          let answer = ref(null);
          let score = ref(0);


          // this setTimeout runs once and then stops
          // I asked github copilot how to make it repeat itself
          // copilot explained that setInterval was what to use here instead.
          setInterval(() => {
            score.value--;
            //this was to confirm that the score was decreasing each second
            // textPrompt.value = score
            // console.log(score.value);

            //this was to check answer's value in the console when it wasn't appearing in the input text
            // console.log(answer.value);
          }, 1000);

          return { textPrompt, answer };
        },
      };

      // I had to take a look at this line of code because I only got something close to:
      // "createApp.(App).mount("#App"); and I know I'm missing a method name that I need here"
      // correction: there isn't a missing method, it's that createApp is itself a function and not an object handle
      createApp(App).mount("#App");
    </script>
  </body>

    - Issues encountered while making this -


    Issue 1 (solved but 1.b now exists):

  - I have set up a beginning state like this:

  <body>
    <div id="App">
      <div>{{textPrompt}}</div>
      <input type="text" v-mode="answer" placeholder="Enter answers here" />
    </div>
  </body>

  <script>
    const { createApp, ref, computed } = Vue;

    const App = {
        Setup() {
            let textPrompt = ref("Next Question");
            let answer = ref("ok");

            return { textPrompt, answer }
        }
    }

    createApp(App).mount("#App");
  </script>

    But I am given warnings that 'textPrompt' and 'answer' are never defined, along with an issue saying 'failed to resolve directive:mode'

    I think it might be because I put the script tag outside of the body as my first guess, so I'll move that and if that doesn't fix it I'll check the other file to see what might be wrong with this.

    This did not solve it, so I am going to check the other file to see what might be different.

    The very first thing that I checked was that my function was named Setup, and the one in the other file was setup, so I'm changing that with the expectation that this is an obvious looking explanation for those warnings

    This has solved it, issue 1 resolved


    Issue 1.b:

    However, there is still the Vue warn:  'Failed to resolve directive: mode' and it seems to be from the line using createApp(App).mount("#App"), even though the ref values are rendering properly




    Issue 2:

    - a means of detecting an enter key being pressed to save, evaluate the answer and move to the next question
    
    has not been shown in the course, so some knowledge of how to do that either with regular javascript 
    
    or with Vue methodology needs to be looked up in documentation / github copilot etc.


      I have gotten to the point of the question text being asked, and the input field being v-model bound to answer

      now I need a way to press enter, detect that event, and compare answer to the current question['answer']



    Issue 3 (solved):

    I am trying to make the input field show the text of the answer using an initial string "ok" 
    
    but it shows an empty input box or the placeholder text instead

    I was able to confirm in the console that answer.value is "ok", but the input field it is v-model's to is blank

    I fixed it by realizing I had a typo 'v-mode' and changed it to 'v-model' and it works now
