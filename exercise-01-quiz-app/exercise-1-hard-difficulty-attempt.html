Quiz App Exercise

The teacher suggested doing this exercise in one of several varying levels of challenge/difficulty.

The way I wanted to do it was to just see the demonstration of the quiz app functions, then make it myself without any starter code and without seeing the logic flowchart yet

Then after doing this, I want to see what the logic flowchart shows to see what might have been missed or is of interest to notice

Information About Quiz App Based On Demonstration of it:

Text on top,
Input field (for answers) below text


your goal is to answer the questions as quickly as possible, so that implies that there might be an ascending timer that is used to impact the score by perhaps subtracting the seconds taken from the score points


The question texts say:

Next question
How much is 2+2

Next question
How much is 3*5+1

Next question
What is the result from 3/1

you type an answer into the input field and pressing enter will clear the input field and change the question text to the next one

Finally It has a text on top:

"Your Score: 3"
over top of an input field


So it doesn't say "right, wrong" while taking the quiz but just shows a score at the end without indicating which questions were answered right


My plan will be to store the questions as objects in an array of objects, with 'question' text and 'answer' text, where they can be shifted from the first element of the list and asked

a way to detect enter key press needs to happen so an event can cause the input answer to be evaluated against the question object's answer key, and a score variable tallied

there is also a repeating settimeout that runs for 1000 milliseconds and reduces score by 1 each timeout



The entire app will be typed from memory or imagination, including the script area that launches the Vue app, except for:

    - the initial html ! boilerplate shortcut
    - the urls to the unpkg for normalize.css and for Vue
    - any places where I got stuck and had to refer to the can-you-drive.html for a hint - and lines where that has occurred will be marked with comments saying so

          let answer = ref(null);
          let score = ref(0); //I notice that score doesn't need to be a ref value but it doesn't harm anything that it is

          // this setTimeout runs once and then stops
          // I asked github copilot how to make it repeat itself
          // copilot explained that setInterval was what to use here instead.
          setInterval(() => {
            score.value--;
            //this was to confirm that the score was decreasing each second
            // textPrompt.value = score
            // console.log(score.value);

            //this was to check answer's value in the console when it wasn't appearing in the input text

          const checkAnswer = () => {
            const correctAnswer =
              answer.value === currentQuestion.answer ? true : false;
            console.log(`checked answer, and it was: ${correctAnswer}`);

            if (correctAnswer) {
              score.value += 5;
            }

            // clear the answer text box
            answer.value = "";

            // get the next question until they run out, then show final score
            currentQuestion = questions.shift();
            textPrompt.value = currentQuestion
              ? currentQuestion.question
              : `Your Score ${score.value}`;
          };

          return { textPrompt, answer, checkAnswer };
        },
      };

      // I had to take a look at this line of code because I only got something close to:
      // "createApp.[methodname?](App).mount("#App"); and I know I'm missing a method name that I need here"
      // correction: there isn't a missing method, it's that createApp is itself a function and not an object handle
      createApp(App).mount("#App");
    </script>
  </body>

<!--
    - Issues encountered while making this -


    Issue 1 (solved but 1.b now exists):

  - I have set up a beginning state like this:

  <body>
    <div id="App">
      <div>{{textPrompt}}</div>
      <input type="text" v-mode="answer" placeholder="Enter answers here" />
    </div>
  </body>

  <script>
    const { createApp, ref, computed } = Vue;

    const App = {
        Setup() {
            let textPrompt = ref("Next Question");
            let answer = ref("ok");

            return { textPrompt, answer }
        }
    }

    createApp(App).mount("#App");
  </script>

    But I am given warnings that 'textPrompt' and 'answer' are never defined, along with an issue saying 'failed to resolve directive:mode'

    I think it might be because I put the script tag outside of the body as my first guess, so I'll move that and if that doesn't fix it I'll check the other file to see what might be wrong with this.

    This did not solve it, so I am going to check the other file to see what might be different.

    The very first thing that I checked was that my function was named 'Setup', and the one in the other file was 'setup', so I'm changing that with the expectation that this is an obvious looking explanation for those warnings

    This has solved it, issue 1 resolved


    Issue 1.b (solved inadvertently):

    However, there is still the Vue warn:  'Failed to resolve directive: mode' and it seems to be from the line using createApp(App).mount("#App"), even though the ref values are rendering properly

    Note: this warning has stopped appearing by itself by the time I was working on Issue 2 but I don't yet know why it appeared or disappeared.



    Issue 2 (solved):

    - a means of detecting an enter key being pressed to save, evaluate the answer and move to the next question
    
    has not been shown in the course, so some knowledge of how to do that either with regular javascript 
    
    or with Vue methodology needs to be looked up in documentation / github copilot etc.


      I have gotten to the point of the question text being asked, and the input field being v-model bound to answer

      now I need a way to press enter, detect that event, and compare answer to the currentQuestion['answer']

      I could get the input element and add an event listener,

      I could use something like @OnChanged in the element tag itself perhaps,

      I want to see if there is a 'Vue way' to do it, so for that I'm going to prompt github copilot to check that

      Copilot explained that I could add something like '@keyup.enter=checkAnswer()' in the input field, 
      
      and then implement a function that evaluates answers by making that function within setup(){}

        I implemented this, but it didn't work at first,

        then I reviewed the copilot suggestion and realized that checkAnswer delegate had to be returned 
        
        out of setup() for it to be usable in the @keyup event, 
        
        and I also noticed myself that I needed write it as checkAnswer and not checkAnswer() in the @keyup event.

        Now I have an event by which I can increment the questions and evaluate and tally scores

    
    
      Issue 3 (solved):

      I am trying to make the input field show the text of the answer using an initial string "ok" 
  
      but it shows an empty input box or the placeholder text instead

      I was able to confirm in the console that answer.value is "ok", but the input field it is v-model's to is blank

      I fixed it by realizing I had a typo 'v-mode' and changed it to 'v-model' and it works now



      Issue 4 (solved):

      I have it so that if I press enter 3 times without entering anything, it shows "Your Score: 3" as expected

      And I also have it so that if I enter a right or wrong anwswer, the console logs 'true' and 'false' for

      whether the input answer matches the expected answer

      however when I go to write correct answers into the input, the final score appears as undefined

      if I enter no answers, I get a proper numeric score, but if I enter actual answers, it is undefined.


      it was because of this:

        if (correctAnswer) {
          score += 5;
        }
        
        needed to be:
        
        if (correctAnswer) {
          score.value += 5;
        }
        


      At this point, all issues are solved and the entire functionality explained and demonstrated appears to be in place.

      Making final commit and then checking against the flowchart and solutions the teacher shows

      I will be especially interested in seeing how he got the enter key press implemented vs what I had




      Differences in the teacher's solution that are noteworthy:


        ... I notice that in mine, score didn't need to be a ref because I used score.value directly in an interpolated
        string and not in the usual {{vueBinding}} way, so my score decrementing setInterval was still running and
        lowering the score at the end of the quiz, not intentionally, while the score.value that was printed at the
        time was correct and holds fixed in the ui as intended.

        What I could have done differently was make {{score}} appear in the UI and then make sure to stop the
        setInterval from running any further


        I also see that yes the teacher does use a const i = setInterval and then a clearInterval(i) from within the
        setInterval to control this timer functionality

        My code flow is essentially the same as what he shows in his logic flowchart outside of the fact that the
        clearInterval() happens in his and not in mine


        REGARDING PRESSING ENTER TO COLLECT AND EVALUATE ANSWER:

        the teacher doesn't implement such a thing as pressing a confirm/submit key like enter,

        he just uses a 4 second interval in which the answer currently in the input field will be taken and assessed



        Other noteworthy differences:


        he used an array of just questions, and an array of just answers, and seemed to use 
        incrementing an indexer to access them rather than my array and shifting objects out 
        of it with question and answer properties


        He indicated that his 'current' question value needed to be reactive but mine was not.  
        I don't yet see why he needs his to be until I see his solution implementation.


        Major difference:  He uses computed() properties to get the question to ask, as well as 
        to check whether an answer is right or now, and an 'areWeDone' value, and I did not use 
        computed() anywhere in my script.




        What I want to see as he shows his solution walkthrough:

          How did he use computed values in his example, since I didn't use them in mine?


          he did it like this:

            const current = computed(
              () => questions[current.value]
            );

            const rightAnswer = computed(
              () => answers[current.value]
            );

            const areWeDone = computed(
              () => answers.length = current.value
            );


            This shows how his code is a little more declarative looking where mine runs like a step by step process


            The way he wrote out "Next Question" and "Your Score" and how the question was printed in the UI was
            insignificantly different than how I had mine, but his didn't have repeats of 'Next Question' written, and
            it used score as a reactive ref value in the UI which is a bit more correct for this exercise

            He also sets the next answer field to null where I use ""

            He doesn't have something that decreases the score as time goes on
