# exercise-01-quiz-app

The teacher gave an exercise where we could either watch a demonstration of a quiz app and then make it ourselves from scratch, or else allow him to walk us through a logic flowchart before making it, or else let him walk us through a starter code template before making it, or else just watch what he does in the solution video.

I made it from scratch without looking at the flow chart or starter code, and then made extensive comment notes to describe issues that I encountered and how I solved them, as well as to take notes about how the teacher's solution and methods differed from what I did.
