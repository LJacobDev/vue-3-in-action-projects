<!-- 
    This is a rewrite of the task list project, but fully done from memory, 
    in order to show that I was able to understand the key ideas.
    Some CSS styling may differ, but the functionality will be right.


    Comments containing text: 'FIX THIS' mark areas where things aren't working properly yet

    currently:

        the priority coloured border is not appearing even though I meant for it to
        the select box is not defaulting to 'select a priority' even though I meant for it to

    I have all of the rest of the functionality done except saving and loading with localStorage, and the filter

    I'll add the filter and localStorage, 
    then I might look at the reference material to figure out my two unsolved issues

    localStorage worked fine,
    my filter of the tasks made the tasks stop appearing, so I will want to check that in the original too

    Things to check in the original:

    - how to make 'Select a priority' appear as default in the select input
    - how to make the priorty colour coded left border appear on the task items
    - how to make the filter show filtered tasks and not go blank like it was doing

    Reasons why these three issues happened / what was found out about fixing them:


    ... incidentally, I omitted the :key="task.id" which is something I was hoping not to do, 
    as I want to remember to use :key in every v-for that I can

    ... added :key="task.id"

    ... when I added attribute ' value="" ' to the select element, the 'select a priority' default text appeared

    ... the border color missing was fixed by adding the style rule 'solid' next to the px size of border-left

    ... the filtered tasks were showing blank results becaus I hadn't returned filteredTasks array in the setup method


    Now everything works just like the original intended functionality
