# p04-event-booking-rewrite

After completing the video course sections that creates the booking app, I wanted to rewrite the same thing from scratch and from memory in order to ensure that the concepts in the videos were usefully understood by me.

The design and content might vary from the original and this is more about practicing with Vite and the Vue framework. It also might not get fully completed, as it was mainly an exercise for practicing some aspects of working with Vue.
